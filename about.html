	    <h2> Who are we </h2>
	    <p>Kaffelicious is a quality-focused, community hub located in coastal san diego county.  Lofty was started in 2011  as a corner cafe on historic coast hwy 101 in encinitas, california. “our ethos”,  was the guiding vision for the original cafe and continues to guide us as we grow. In the five years since our founding, we have expanded to three locations including a production facility where we roast our coffee and bake our pastries from scratch. Sourcing organic ingredients from local producers keeps our breakfast and lunch menus full of fresh and healthy options. Running our business in a sustainable manner is of equal importance to our commitment to producing quality products. As a locally owned business, we are committed to providing our community with superior coffee, artisanal food and exceptional customer service. We don’t need to write your name on a cup because we already know it.</p>

	    <h2> What do we do </h2>
	    <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
